# About me
Hi, I've recently received my Ph.D. in the Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University, located in Boston, MA. My academic journey started with a B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran in 2014. Following that, I pursued my M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA in 2018.

My research interests include machine learning, graph mining, and optimization. I'm passionate about developing innovative algorithms and models that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of real-world systems.

Apart from research, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others and learning from the community. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.
